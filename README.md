We have decided to built Quiz Application in which a student can answer some random questions.

The Application have following steps included:

1.	User login in application through his/her credential if he/she has registered account.

2.	If student have no registered account, then application navigate him/her to registration page, where student need to insert his/her student-id, name, username and create new password.

3.	After successfully logged in student can view his/her name on homepage and he/she can start quiz as well from this page.

4.	Student can give answers to random multiple-choice questions in application.

5.	Student can view their score after completing the quiz.
